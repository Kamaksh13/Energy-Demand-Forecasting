# Energy-Demand-Forecasting-Using-ARIMA

Developed an end-to-end solution for energy demand forecasting using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), leveraging time-series data to make accurate predictions and improve resource planning.


	•	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python (pandas, matplotlib) to visualize trends and seasonal patterns in the time-series dataset from Kaggle.
	•	Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values (using pandas fill methods) and converting timestamps to datetime format.
	•	Ensured data stationarity by conducting Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests and applying necessary transformations like differencing and logarithmic adjustments.
	•	Built ARIMA models with hyperparameter tuning (manual and grid search) to identify the optimal p, d, q values.
	•	Split data into training and test sets, evaluated model performance using RMSE, and iteratively improved the model through parameter adjustments.
	•	Visualized actual vs. predicted results to assess the model’s predictive performance.
